# Studying Model-View-Controller

In this project i follow a simple guide learning how to use Spring Boot in a MVC design pattern.

These concepts/applications are new to me, so the project is just do undestand the relation between classes and some annotations of Spring.

Used dependencies:
- Lombok
- Spring Boot DevTools
- Spring Web
- Spring Data JPA
- MySQL Driver

Indirectly, i also applied some knowledge about MySQL and DBMS (Data Base Management System) in Linux (Ubuntu).

For future studies it would be interesting make an API that connect a front-end to back-end.
